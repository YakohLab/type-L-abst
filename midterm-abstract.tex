\section{Introduction}
One common lightwave telecommunication method is infrared, widely used in remote controllers for consumer electronics.
Although, since infrared communication runs at a low modulation frequency of \SI{38}{kHz}, and a much lower symbol rate, obtaining a compromisable data rate is a challenge.
Ever since the improvement of radio frequency (RF) telecommunication, it has not drawn much attention.

Nonetheless, despite it was impossible with any existing protocols, by carefully designing a new protocol, a reasonable data rate, with multiuser characteristics can be achieved.
Multiuser characteristics are essential when considering an open environment, where many terminals enter and leave the communication channel on the fly.

The proposal in this thesis is a tightly packed frame protocol, enabling multiuser access in an open environment.
The system is implemented as a system on a chip (SoC), enabling us an appropriate balance of performance and flexibility.

\section{Conventional protocols}
To today, many proposed their protocol for their intended use, each with advantages and disadvantages.
Here, the present protocols referred upon designing protocol is listed.

\subsection{Time division multiple access}
Time-division multiple access (TDMA) is a protocol, which assigns ``time-slot'' exclusive to each terminal, along with a ``guard-time'' between each time-slot to avoid overlapping of transmission, when two or more users have different propagation delays.
During the assigned time-slot, each terminal is allowed to communicate.

However, since TDMA divides time, a synchronisation between terminals is required.
Also, each terminal in TDMA must be pre-configured which time-slot to use, making it useless in open environments.

\subsection{Ethernet for Control Automation Technology}
Ethernet for Control Automation Technology (EtherCAT) is a protocol where a network controller controls the whole network.
Data is interchanged by circulating frames transmitted by the controller in the network.
Only when a frame arrives, each terminal is allowed to read/write data.
After the terminal finished reading/writing, it transmits the frame to the next.
By performing this read/write/transmit procedure on-the-fly, high-speed communication is possible.

However, since each terminal in EtherCAT must be pre-configured, it is also useless in open environments.
Also, EtherCAT is a protocol for wired telecommunication, requiring a daisy-chain connection.

\section{Proposed protocol}
The protocol is a connection-oriented full-duplex protocol, using the lightwave channel.
It involves several terminals, which communicate simultaneously with each other using the established session, and a central controller, to manage the network and sessions, as illustrated in \ref{fig:overview}.

\end{figure}

The controller gives each terminal in its network two blocks, a unit of communication used in the protocol.
One is used to exchange data from the terminal to the controller (uplink).
The other is for the controller to the terminal (downlink).
Each terminal receives data from the given downlink block, and writes to its uplink block on the fly, building a single frame structure, as shown in \ref{fig:frame}, as a whole network.
This behaviour, based on EtherCAT, is to relish the decreased delay EtherCAT offers since each terminal does not have to process the entire frame to transmit its data.

  \begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{ccl}
    \hline
    Identifier & Name & Description\\
    \hline \hline
    R & Register & Join network\\
    U & Unregister & Leave network\\
    D & Connect & Establish session\\
    H & Disconnect & Demolish current session\\
    \hline
  \end{tabularx}
\end{table}

Since dealing with open environments, each terminal must be able to join/leave the network and establish/demolish its sessions.
For this purpose, a contention-window-like request section is introduced.
An open environment behaviour is achieved by transmitting requests to the controller (uplink request) using the request section.
All requests are defined in the request protocol, along with an identifier to reduce transmission, as shown in \ref{tab:request}.
The controller processes these requests and responds (downlink request) along with additional information.
The protocol splits the request section, for the downlink request not to collide with the uplink request since downlink requests transmit information to maintain a stable, predictable network.
On the other side, uplink requests are vulnerable to collisions; if many terminals make uplink requests at the same time, requests will collide and lead to unsuccessful uplink requests.
This problem is solved by each terminal retrying the same request after waiting a random amount of frames.

\section{Implementation}
To satisfy the above-mentioned protocol, a SoC implementation, especially Zynq\textregistered -7000 SoC from Xilinx\textregistered, was chosen.

The controller and terminal is shown in \ref{fig:controller} and \ref{fig:terminal} respectivly.
Both the controller and terminal operate data by opening the gate at the exact time.
Both operate with its oscillator; however, for terminals phase synchronisation is necessary.

\section{Evaluation}
To validate the protocol two evaluations were done.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Evaluation 1}, validated the open environmental performance of the protocol, using a terminal (Terminal A) and controller.
The terminal successfully registered to the network.
  Upon un-registration, the unused blocks were released.
  %% \ref{fig:register} shows the registering process.

\item \textbf{Evaluation 2}, validated the multiuser performance of the protocol, using two terminals (Terminal A, B) with an established session.
Two terminals could successfully simultaneously transmit/receive data.
  \ref{fig:messaging} and \ref{fig:message} shows the on the fly messaging, and the messaging process, respectively.
\end{itemize}
\section{Conclusion}
This thesis presented a new protocol, aimed to enable multiuser telecommunication in an open environment with low symbol rate systems.
A central controller was introduced to enable multiuser specifications.
To decrease the delay by transmitting multiple messages for communication, transmitting/receiving messages on the fly.
The system was implemented to an SoC to realise these specifications and verified that it met the specifications.
